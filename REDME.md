<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The Travel Bucket List app is made for people who love to travel. It lets users add new travel destinations they want to visit, see the full list of places they added, and update the status to show if they have already visited the place or not. Users can also delete a destination from the list if they change their mind. The app helps users keep track of their travel dreams in a simple and organized way.
